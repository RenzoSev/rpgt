# Abstract
This present research project (TCC) investigates how to exploit loopholes in the ranking system of the Fisk website to improve one's score and achieve a first-place ranking. The motivation for this project was to understand the inner workings of the ranking system and identify potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the project aimed to demonstrate the potential impact of such loopholes on the overall fairness and accuracy of the ranking system.
The research involved a combination of theoretical analysis and practical experimentation. The first step was to identify potential loopholes in the ranking system by carefully examining the system's rules. Once potential loopholes were identified, practical experiments were conducted to verify their effectiveness and quantify their impact on the ranking score.
This research project has important implications for both the Fisk website and the broader field of online ranking systems. The findings of this project can help the Fisk website improve the security and fairness of its ranking system by addressing the identified loopholes. Additionally, the project's findings can contribute to the development of more robust and secure ranking systems in other online contexts.

# Introduction
On an ordinary day, while browsing the Fisk website, the discrepancy in the ranking scores sparked my curiosity. Exorbitant scores of some users challenged the logic and fairness of the system. This discrepancy prompted a deep investigation, leading to this study.
The central objective of this work is to unravel the loopholes in the Fisk website's ranking system. Through a meticulous analysis of the website's code structure, we aim to identify the flaws that allow artificial manipulation of scores.
In this work, we explore the Fisk ranking system, its applications, and the problems related to score manipulation. Through concrete examples and illustrations, we elucidate the key concepts and relevant terminology.

# Cyber Fisk

## What is Cyber Fisk?
First and  foremost, Cyber Fisk is an educational platform provided for Fisk. This platform offers students the opportunity to improve their writing, listening, and speaking skills through online exercises. Furthermore, it is not a simple educational system: **it is gamified.**

## Gamification
Gamification is an innovative approach to increase participation and interaction within a non-gaming community. Through gamification, websites can incorporate game mechanics, such as rankings, level, xp, score, points and other metrics to improve engagement. In an educational environment, gamification becomes particularly interesting to capture the attention of the students, offering a new approach to teach and learn.
In a technical/programming context, gamification introduces additional challenges to ensure the smooth operation of the website. It is necessary to guarantee users a great experience, free from any website bugs or issues, while also preventing any potential cheating.

Every software or website has vulnerabilities; it is almost impossible to eliminate all possibilities of attack. The complexity of an application usually increases the chances of being hacked. The situation is no different for gamification. Integrating an entire RPG game environment into your website opens vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit your site.

With that, the central question comes: can Cyber Fisk be hacked? This Final Paper aims to provide a definitive answer, and the spoiler is: ***yes, we can!***
With this final paper, I will demonstrate how I achieved the top position on the CyberFisk Rank with a score of **15.063.206.**
